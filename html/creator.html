<p>I play video games which require foresight, reflexes, and input dexterity, which makes for death defying virtual experiences. These death defying experiences a lot of times require very rapid and mechanically intensive input processing through the hands against various controller interfaces. This lends a hand to playing guitar with more accuracy in dynamics, timing, and speed. Both the video game input processing and guitar playing provide transferrable speed and accuracy in using the computer keyboard. The reflexes and timing make it so that keyboard shortcuts and commands are inputted very rapidly to make sequences of computer functions occur very rapidly. The faster the computer, the better, because it can keep up with my rapid input processing.</p>

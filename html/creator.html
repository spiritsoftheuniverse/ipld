<p>I am Michael Nguyen, creator of Internet Public Library and a lifelong artist who has done multiple lifetimes worth of work across multiple domains. Whatever I touch, I aim to know enough about it in order to make it serviceable under the utility belt.</p>
<p>I play video games which require foresight, reflexes, and input dexterity. This makes for death defying virtual experiences, which a lot of times require very rapid and mechanically intensive input processing from the hands against various controller interfaces. Video game input dexterity is a transferrable skill, and this lends a hand to playing guitar with more accuracy in dynamics, timing, and speed. Both video game input processing and guitar playing provide transferrable speed and accuracy in using the computer keyboard. Having such dexterity, keyboard shortcuts and commands are inputted in rapid succession to make sequences of computer functions occur very rapidly. The faster the computer, the better, because it can keep up with my rapid input processing. This accumulation of transferrable skill is what makes it possible to achieve some form of expertise across any domain.</p>

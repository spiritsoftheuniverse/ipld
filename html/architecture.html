<div class="orbitron"> Development Environment</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>Utilizing the Laragon local development environment, the library is maintained through the L(W)AMP stack : Linux/Windows, Apache server, MySQL, and PHP. Visual Code is used with code coloring necessary for the languages of CSS, HTML, PHP, and Javascript. Whatever version of Gemini that is the latest in Google AI Studio is the LLM of use for coding assistance. If Gemini is temporarily rate limited, then Chat GPT is used with caution alongside with its small jobs. Github is bound to Visual Studio Code for periodic commits as a means of critical code backup and restoration.</p>

<div class="orbitron">Databases</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>Each dataset implementation has its own database in MySQL. Mediawiki datasets share a redundant schema that is copied in structure for every new implementation. All other databases are uniquely created based on the structure of meta-data that is retrieved from an API or data source, mentioned in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="nounderline pagelink"  data="curation" style="font-weight: normal;">curation page</a>. This causes the indexing to also be unique between each implementation; utilizing b-tree, full-text, and composite indexes where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="orbitron">Index Page</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>
                The flow of the index page:
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>Start a php session.</li>
                <li>Render index.php</li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div class="orbitron">User Interface</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>
                The interactive components in the UI of an implementation which behave as catalysts for queries are filter toggles, category links, and search field.
                Category links and search confirmations trigger the running of a controller script on the server via ajax. Filter and query information passed to post data in this process and waits for a response.
        </p>
</div>
<div class="orbitron">Server Response</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>
                When receiving the call from ajax, the controller script assigns a get value from the parameter segment of the url, which is compared in a switch statement in order to determine the assignment of configuration files and further script includes.
        </p>
        <p>
                The configuration file starts a session, then gets sensitive strings from an .env file and stores them as php variables in preparation for any api calls or database access. It is usually a dependency for any includes which follow it.
        </p>
        <p>
                Any includes after the configuration file are scripts which validate post data and query the database for record data that is echoed as json to the front-end for html parsing. 
                In this process, queries are constructed with post data for filtration, category specifications, or text search. One running script accepts all methods of query, and post data is compared to determine which method is to be used as the query.
        </p>

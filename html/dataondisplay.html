<div class="m24">
        <p>
                The library organizes each implementation's navigation options in the user-interface as a map to everything. Table of Contents, content filters, and category links all assist in guiding the user through the whole dataset.
        </p>
        <p>Query results are optimized for <em>data-immediacy</em>, exposing all data directly within the results page. This eliminates back-and-forth page traversal by eliminating the full-details page.</p>

        <p>The exposure of full-data on every record in view is as functional as it is aesthetic. The content volume occupies comfortable amounts of space, while the data is made readably dense, like that of Japanese product packaging.  </p>
        <p>
                Vertical spacing is carefully maintained with various content collapsing methods. Long text is collapsed into description containers with <em>show-more</em> toggles. Panels are tabbed in order to alter context within the same space, which both introduces and relieves layout shifting.

<div class="orbitron">Pagination</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>
        The library uses offset pagination for smaller datasets. For deep paging, both keyset and offset pagination are used together. The page-limit is curated for each implementation based on the average html output length of a query. Art museums mostly show 20 records per query due to their meta-data and thumbnail richness. Implementations with less meta-data output will show a higher number of records.

<div class="orbitron">Lazy Loading</div>
<div class="m24">
        Lazy loading of images at the library is primarily for respecting online traffic. It was forced into creation when viewing <em>The Smithsonian Field Book Project</em>, which is a department from The Smithsonian that has dozens of thumbnails per record. Even with a 20 record limit per page, the amount of thumbnails forced rate-limiting from the image server (IDS) against the IP-address in which data was being received. Deferring the loading based on viewing proximity solved the issue and lazy loading has since been implemented into nearly every dataset.

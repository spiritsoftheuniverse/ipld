        Mediawiki at the library does not run as a stand-alone application like it usually does on the web. It is instead used as a php-library which manages data and serves raw wikitext that is parsed with a set of php scripts. It does not use any template html or css native to the dataset. This allows all Mediawiki datasets to use the same css styles of the library while also making unruly elements such as tables (with too many columns) become readable in a narrow viewing space, by turning the tables into carded data. A Mediawiki implementation serves to improve readability and access in multiple ways while minimizing sacrifices. For example, since <em>table of contents</em> is a newly introduced user-interface element that takes up horizontal space, removed are the <em>infoboxes</em> in the top right side of the page that are a common part of wikipedia layouts. These elements are instead rendered on top of the article as if the page were always in mobile view.

<p>For Mediawiki, wikitext parsing is an ongoing task. Every Mediawiki dataset so far has had different tables and templates, which requires writing of more parsing rules. Out of a multi-thousand page dataset, it is dutiful to go through enough of its page types to evaluate the output for parsing errors, especially if the dataset has had a history of varied page construction such as the Hot Wheels Wiki.</p>

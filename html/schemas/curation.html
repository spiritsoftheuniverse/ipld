<div class="m24">
        <p>A dataset which passes for implementation is one where data structure is clean &amp; consistent, has no usage-limitations for how anything is built around it, and is rich in media if any media is involved. Easy-pick examples include Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Smithsonian since their institutional data is well structured, their usage-restrictions are clearly stated; and even after data-pruning of media-poor records, their record counts remain in abundance.</p>

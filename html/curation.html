<div class="orbitron">Dataset Curation</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>A dataset which passes for implementation is one where data structure is clean &amp; consistent, has no usage-limitations for how anything is built around it, and is rich in media if any media is involved. Priding itself in its breadth, the library is open to any kind of subject matter as long as it meets said criteria.</p>
        <p>Examples of winners include Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Smithsonian since their institutional data is well structured, their usage-restrictions are clearly stated; and even after data-pruning of records with no image urls, their record counts remain in abundance. For specialty data such as Mediawiki where there may be dependencies such as Mediawiki extensions, those which pass curation are the ones where the extension(s) do not conflict with the custom-parser that is used to interpret all Mediawiki implementations.</p>
        <p>
                Datasets which do not make it in curation are those that have usage-restrictions on how applications can be built. This excludes every commercial image API such as Pixabay and Unsplash. Non-image APIs with similar policies are also excluded, such as Giant Bomb when it was still active. The library displays plain records and this goes against the usage policy of all commercial APIs.
        </p>
        <p class="mb">
                Content aggregation API's have been excluded, since their image sources are usually low-resolution. The source image Europeana and DPLA are examples of  API's which have this trait among a few things such as taxing functions to verify media availability and abridged meta-data.

<div class="orbitron">Data Curation</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>After a dataset is implemented into the library, data curation involves pruning of media-poor records. There are usually two scenarios for this; the first being records which simply have no attached media to the meta-data, and the second being records where media is in some way truncated due to copyright restrictions. With many datasets being abundant in records, pruning in any number of results against these records is not something that the user will miss or even acknowledge. Completeness is important for records pertaining to inventory such as a full checklist of toys or trading cards, but not so much for a collection of museum objects where we have no assurance of how much is supposed to be there. Carded objects without image urls are ignored during queries. </p>
        <p>
                Dataset pruning is handled at ingestion level whenever an API allows, and at query level otherwise.

        Curation beyond inclusion and exclusion involves the determining of filters and link navigation.

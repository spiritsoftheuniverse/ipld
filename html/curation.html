<div class="orbitron">Dataset Curation</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>A dataset which passes for implementation is one where data structure is clean &amp; consistent, has no usage-limitations for how anything is built around it, and is rich in media if any media is involved. Priding itself in its breadth, the library is open to any kind of subject matter as long as it meets said criteria.</p>
        <p>Examples of winners include Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Smithsonian since their institutional data is well structured, their usage-restrictions are clearly stated; and even after data-pruning of media-poor records, their record counts remain in abundance. For specialty data such as Mediawiki where there may be dependencies such as Mediawiki extensions, those which pass curation are the ones where the extension(s) do not conflict with the custom-parser that is used to interpret all Mediawiki implementations.</p>
        <p>
                Datasets which fail curation as already mentioned are those which have usage-restrictions on how applications can be built. This easily excludes every commercial image API such as Pixabay and Unsplash, since they say that their data cannot be used to create a  &quot;competing application&quot;. Any organization with similar policies are also excluded, such as Giant Bomb when it was still active. These commercial API's shutter due to their uselessness through their stringent policies, and the library is not risking loss of data over conservative generosity. An example of this is when Marvel API shut down their comics API on Wednesday, October 29, 2025. Their API was a peculiar case where the return data was eventually pruned to become less useful, then ultimately being shuttered entirely because it has no practical meaning in their business. Data management in such a way is not very respectable, therefore any datasets which behave like this are immediate warning signs for exclusion.

<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environment which displays information from web libraries and datasets through a science-fiction inspired interface.
        With careful consideration, the library unearths compelling records that are littered throughout the ages of media as well as implement the datasets of today and tomorrow so that anybody can have access to all of it. 
        It can be used for discovery, learning, or visiting a certain era of something. Whether an artist is looking for visual references or whether someone is curious about what a printing of something looked like in the 70's, anyone can benefit from the presence of record meta-data, which offers context and sources to the objects and stories being viewed. Visual reference <em>with</em> data rather than <em>without</em> makes a great difference in the potential for a richer learning experience that would otherwise not be there if one were to browse for images in a content aggregation site where original data and sources are not cited.</p>
       <p>Datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system as a whole ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. Each dataset or in-house application is its own engine, or set of scripts. Any applicable filters and navigations are unique to each implementation while still having overall user-interface similiarity across the site, letting data in abundance and variance become accessible with familiarity. Scouting for new dataset implementations happens regularly during development with no restrictions on subject matter.</p>
       <p>Whether the data is open or gray-area, is updating or is a static archive, keeping data live on the library is a hope for digital media preservation and education. </p>

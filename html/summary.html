<div class="orbitron">About the Library.</div>
<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environnment which displays information from web libraries and datasets. It can be used for discovery, learning, or going to a certain era of something. Artists who are looking for visual references can benefit from contextual data, which provides context and sources to objects and stories. These datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. </p>
       <p>Each dataset or in-house application is its own engine. Any applicable filters and navigations are bespoke to each implementation while still having overall user-interface similiarity across the site, letting heterogenous data in abundance and variance become accessible with familiarity. </p>
       <p> Whether the data is open or gray-area, is updating or is a static archive, keeping data on the library is a hope for digital media preservation. Respectfully caring for cultural history and having it available for anyone is the goal.</p>

<div class="orbitron">About the Library.</div>
<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environnment which displays information from web libraries and datasets. It is open to anyone who wants to look, can be used for discovery, learning, or reminiscing about a certain era of something. Artists who are looking for visual references can also learn from the meta-data, which provides context and sources to objects and stories. These datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. </p>
       <p>The experience becomes transformative when large amounts of contextual data bundled together. It creates a convenience that is unique from sites like Pinterest and Tumblr where media is only partially contextual or referenced. When data intends to be as informative as it can be, it makes a greater difference to the recipient regardless of why the information is being gathered. Each dataset or in-house application is its own engine. Any applicable filters and navigations are bespoke to each implementation while still having the overall user-interface be familiar across the site.</p>
       <p>The library is a place of stewardship for digital media wherever mirroring is feasible, whether the data is open or gray-area. Digital media preservation has been in crisis for years. We need to start defending our history more meaningfully because we cannot afford to lose the records of our progress.</p>

<div class="orbitron">About the Library.</div>
<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environnment which displays information from web libraries and datasets. It is open to anyone who has a reason to look. It can be used for discovery, learning, or reminiscing about a certain era of something. Artists who are looking for visual references can possibly learn from the meta-data, which provides context and sources to objects and stories. These datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. </p>
       <p>The experience is transformative when large amounts of contextual data are bundled together. It creates a browsing scenario that is unique from sites like Pinterest and Tumblr where media is only partially contextual or referenced. When data intends to be as informative as it can be, it makes a greater difference to the recipient regardless of why the information is being gathered. Each dataset or in-house application is its own engine. Any applicable filters and navigations are bespoke to each implementation while still having overall user-interface similiarity across the site, letting heterogenous data in abundance and variance become accessible with familiarity. </p>
       <p>Keeping data live on the library is an initiative towards digital media preservation wherever mirroring is feasible; whether the data is open or gray-area, is updating or is a static archive.</p>

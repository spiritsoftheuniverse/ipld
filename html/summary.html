<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environment which displays information from web libraries and datasets through a science-fiction inspired interface. 
        It can be used for discovery, learning, or visiting a certain era of something. Whether an artist is looking for visual references or whether someone is curious about what a printing of something looked like in the 70's, anyone can benefit from the presence of record meta-data, which offers context and sources to the objects and stories being viewed. </p>
       <p>Datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system as a whole ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. Each dataset or in-house application is its own engine, or set of scripts. Any applicable filters and navigations are unique to each implementation while still having overall user-interface similiarity across the site, letting data in abundance and variance become accessible with familiarity. Scouting for new dataset implementations happens regularly during development with no restrictions on subject matter.</p>
       <p>Whether the data is open or gray-area, is updating or is a static archive, keeping data live on the library is a hope for digital media preservation and education. </p>

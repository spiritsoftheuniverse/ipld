<div class="orbitron">About the Library.</div>
<div class="m24">
       <p> The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference environnment which displays information from web libraries and datasets. It is open to anyone who wants to look, can be used for discovery, learning, or reminiscing about a certain era of something. Artists who are looking for visual references can also learn from the meta-data, which provides context and sources to objects and stories. These datasets come from a range of sources including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system ingests heterogeneous data, organizes it, and renders it through a single page application. </p>
       <p>With large amounts of contextual data bundled together and presented through familiar UI between every implementation, the experience is transformative. It creates a peculiar kind of convenience that is unique from sites like Pinterest and Tumblr where media is only partially contextual or referenced. </p>
       <p>In so many ways, digital media preservation has been in crisis, and we need to step up a defend our history in any way possible. We cannot afford to lose the records of our progress any longer. The library is a place of stewardship for digital media where mirroring is feasible, whether the data is open or gray-area.</p>

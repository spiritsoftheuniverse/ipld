        <p>The library is not limited to the presentation of external datasets. It has the Music Theory application and its own dictionary that is always available at the bottom left side of the screen.  </p>

                An article base would serve human written &amp; composed articles of any topics under-represented by other implementations. Navigation starts from an organized index page, similar to how other datasets generally present themselves. The bespoke nature of a human written article allows for the shaping of information that is beyond what ordered records are able to accomplish on their own. Such content would fill in cultural and historical gaps, topics that are absent from all accumulated datasets.

                An implementation such as an article base would be green-lit when progress for institutional API's have settled. It would require a content management system on the front-end with a new database on server-side. Data structures are up in the air as of yet, which is an exciting part of development. It can be anything, collections of static html, ordered JSON data that is parsed on page load, or even be its own Mediawiki dataset where pages are composed in the Mediawiki editor.

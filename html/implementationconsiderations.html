        <p>The library is not limited to the presentation of external datasets. It has the Music Theory application and its own dictionary that is always available at the bottom left of the screen. Other application types are in mind so that under-represented data, or misrepresented data even, have the chance to be presented for better understanding. There are many topics that may fade from any sort of relevance if they aren't to be documented by anyone. </p>

                One new application type that is in consideration for implementation would be an article base. It serves human written &amp; composed articles of any well researched topics; where navigation starts from an organized index page, similar to how other datasets generally present themselves. The bespoke nature of a human written article allows for the shaping of presented information that is beyond what ordered records are able to accomplish on their own. A dataset like this would require a content management system on the front-end with a new database on server-side. Data structures are up in the air as of yet, which is an exciting part of development. It can be anything, static html or ordered JSON data (more likely) that is parsed on page load. The premise behind its presentation is that it is not to be contextually aligned with blog posting. That usually involves making an author the speaker of the content, but any article from the library's article base is meant to be more like a detailed record of a museum topic with no author ownership, which is more in line with what the library serves.

<div class="orbitron">Visual Design</div>
<div class="m24">The library's user-interface is rendered in css and html, serving the look of space-age frosted panels and distinct border-lines as its theme. Graphical personality and functionality are both working together. Such visual design has been abandoned since the release of Windows Vista and has rarely been pursued on the web at all throughout the ages of css. This documentation uses samples of classes from the library's production css.</div>
<div class="orbitron">Page Structure</div>
<div class="m24">
        <p>Most implementations have similar page structure as a base for further navigation. The most common page structure is of two panels on top and one full length panel below the both of them. The top sequence of panels consists of a left column that is roughly 200 pixels wide with another panel beside it that takes up the rest of the horizontal space. In smaller widths, the left panel is responsive and will collapse into a list which becomes set away from view in fixed position. </p>

                3 Panel Structure
        </div>
        <div class="m24">
                In a 3 panel structure, the left column is populated with filtration toggles while the right panel is populated with category-links, and the bottom panel renders query results and potentially the rare case of a gallery-view which shows additional information for a chosen record.
        </div>

        <div class="orbitron">
                2 Panel Structure
        </div>
        <div class="m24">
               <p> In a 2 panel structure, the bottom 3rd panel is omitted and only the top two panels are rendered. Mediawiki implementations are like this because the left column renders the <em>table of contents</em> navigation, while the right panel renders page and category results.</p>
                
                <p>2 panel structure for unique implementations are fundamentally the same. If all filters and category-links fit into the left column, the right panel can then be used for results instead of category-links.</p>

                <p>In recent developments, the 2 panel structure's right panel in some implementations have tabs that determine which contents of the panel are to be displayed. This effectively removes the need for the 3rd panel since category links and results can be separated into separate tabs. 
                        This eliminates vertical document scrolling and keeps all content within view at all times since both the left and right panel each have their own scrollbars which normalize both panels to the same height.</p>

<div class="orbitron">Themes</div>

<div class="m24">
        <p>
                The library has two themes, <em>Shadows</em> and <em>Lights</em>, being dark and light. You can alternate between these themes in the config page of the site, or by using the shortcuts <b>ctrl /</b> or <b>ctrl *</b>. The theme properties are controlled by css variables. Each theme has the same number of properties with the same variable names.
        </p>
        <div class="orbitron">
                Shadows
        </div>
        <div class="m24">
                Shadows is the default theme for the library. It is the dark theme of the site. The background is of space in grayscale. The panels are tinted with pale green to represent neutrality and coolness.
        </div>
        <div class="orbitron">
                Lights
        </div>
        <div class="m24">
                Lights is somewhat an inverse of shadows theme. It is the light theme of the site. The background is the inverse of the grayscale space background, which makes it resemble white marble. The space aesthetic loses its coherency in this theme. The panels are tinted with creamy orange to represent brightness and warmth.
        </div>
</div>
<div class="orbitron">Max Content Width</div>

<div class="m24">
        The user can control how wide the site is to a certain extent in five pixel values: 1024, 1152, 1280, 1600, and 1920. This can be done in the config page of the site, or by using the shortcuts <b>ctrl num1-5</b>. While viewing is mostly comfortable in lower width, some implementations may be more comfortable in a particular width through matter of taste. The music theory application is especially most comfortable in maximum width value of 1920, due to the musical instruments occupying a lot of horizontal space.

<div class="orbitron">About the library.</div>
<div class="m24">
        The Internet Public Library is a free, web-based research and reference platform that consolidates structured information from a wide range of external sources—including public APIs, cultural institutions, and community-maintained wikis. The system ingests heterogeneous data, reorganizes it, and renders it through a single page application. 
        <ul>
                <li>For artists, it provides high-quality visual references.</li>

                <li>For musicians, it offers playback utilities and theory tools.</li>

                <li>For general use, it enables exploration of curated datasets across media, culture, and science.</li>
        </ul>
        With the library's structured data, its use serves to reduce the amount of chaos in reference seeking by adding on opportunities for learning more about what is being looked at through said data.

<div class="m24">
        <p >Datasets that are implemented into the library are limited only by data quality<span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span>.  Subject matter of all kinds are otherwise welcome and scouting for new data happens regularly during development. Each dataset can potentially be very large, documenting millions of records throughout the decades such as data from The Smithsonian and Nasa. It is beautiful to be able to bring forward the world's buried information and make it more easily accessible.</p>
        <p class="mb"><span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span> : Quality data comes as media-rich, complete or adequately complete in record keeping, and reliable in its data-structure.</p>

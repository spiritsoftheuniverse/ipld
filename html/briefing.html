<div class="orbitron">About the library.</div>
<div class="m24">Internet Public Library is an online resource for reference and research that is free to use. It presents abundant, organized information through a science-fiction themed interface. Information is retrieved from numerous organizations, ranging anywhere from art institutions to fan-made wikis. The data is collected, re-organized, and presented with bespoke layout considerations per implementation in the html parsing which is nested in otherwise rather similar user interface panels throughout the whole site. A lot of times it serves the image reference hunter, sometimes it is a music player, sometimes it is a music theory application, but it is always an experience which can lead to learning. </div>

        <p >Datasets that are implemented into the library are limited only by data quality<span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span>.  Subject matter of all kinds are otherwise welcome and scouting for new data happens regularly during development.  The library is of breadth and abundance. Each dataset can potentially be very large with millions of records throughout the decades such as data from The Smithsonian and Nasa. </p>
        <p class="mb"><span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span> : Quality data comes as media-rich, complete or adequately complete in record keeping, and reliable in its data-structure.</p>

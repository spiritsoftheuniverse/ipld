<div class="orbitron">Quiet solutions and problems.</div>
<div class="m24">Sometimes all it takes is to develop things that make little improvements which quietly become a standard. The library is developed in this way while also functioning to solve any problems that it can in the process of collecting, preserving, and presenting data for reference and research. A Quiet solution is more what the library tends to offer, because doing something differently doesn't necessarily solve a problem. It more accurately generates another solution.</div>

<div class="orbitron">Organize the world's information in a way which makes it more immediately accessible to everyone in a cozy environment.</div>
<div class="m24">Data retrieved from a growing list of organizations is served in meaningful, abundant collections that each optimized for their own browsing experience. Having breadth of knowledge all in one place creates a sense of focus when presented with lots of information.  Data which respects context and references makes a natural environment for learning. The choice of which datasets to implement are limited only by any distribution rights that need to be respected. As long as data is not from redundant sources, subject matter is open to any datasets which are media-rich, as if everything presented is keeping in mind anyone who is looking for visual or media reference.</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Presenting data in a way which makes it easier to access all of any corpus.
</div>
<div class="m24 flexcolumn"> 
        Datasets such as Metropolitan Museum of Art or The Smithsonian each have their own uniquely indexed databases so that the user-interfaces for each implementation can be made to guide the researcher to the desired data while also providing more fluidity for presentation of query results. The page layouts for data results are mapped out in such a way that the most information that can be provided at once is presented, which makes any single query substantial. Since the site is visually stylized with lots of graphical compositions from css, the html feeds on the abundance of data and images in order to draw itself on the screen.
</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Presenting data from established structures differently.
</div>
<div class="m24">In the case where data is structured under a framework such as Mediawiki, a table-of-contents is created as a user-interface for accessing a curation of pages. An alteration of major layout structure cannot happen in any live wikipedia application whether it be wikipedia itself or fandom.com pages, so the library serves to take already established datasets and repurpose them to be more accessible. Mediawiki is parsed without any of its original css in mind, reformatted to be styled with the css of the library.</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Style as the substance.
</div>
<div class="m24">
        The library does two things that usually do not go together today, which is be responsive while being graphical with css. The coziness of the site is established with the transparent panels and border lines. It appears to be as science fiction as it can be within the limits of css styles, while also being functionally practical. This manner of style shows that visual personality can certainly be applied to modern layout needs. It is depressing to realize that it is now unusual to represent stylized page layout, which was eclectic by default in the times of print media.
</div>

<div class="orbitron">Curatorial guidance.</div>
<div class="m24">By pruning queries or data in a way which still preserves overall completeness, datasets at the library avoid the meta-data-only problem. People will not miss records of museum objects having no media. The same goes for any records where media quality is underserved due to copyright policies.</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Gray area is a place for preservational progress.
</div>
<div class="m24"> A lot of the commercial world takes itself to the grave even after its days of publication are done, although some change is already happening. Commercial preservation that we have never had the opportunity to keep record of until now without overburden of bandwidth consumption is magazines. <a href="https://retromags.com/" target="_blank">Retromags</a> is an organization which preserves old magazines, and very few companies have asked them to not be in possession of their publications. Not just traditional media, but also digital media from the commercial world can benefit from preservational efforts since they are usually what inspire people to become creators in the modern world.</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Free for everybody.
</div>
<div class="m24">
        There are no account systems, which allows anybody access to it at any time. This makes the visit less restrictive than a physical library, where one needs a card for access. There are no commercial aspects to the site such as advertisements or sponsorship plugs which cut away from the coziness of the design, and if we can get away with not having donation reminders like Wikipedia, that will be an omission as well.

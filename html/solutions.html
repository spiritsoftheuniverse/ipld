<div class="orbitron">Quiet solutions.</div>
<div class="m24"> The library solves any problems that it can in the process of collecting, preserving, and presenting data for reference and research. Quiet solutions are more of what the library tends to lean into. Doing something differently doesn't necessarily solve a problem. It more accurately generates another solution.</div>

<div class="orbitron">Organize the world's information in a way which makes it more immediately accessible to everyone in a cozy environment.</div>
<div class="m24">Data retrieved from a growing list of organizations is served in meaningful, abundant collections that each optimized for their own browsing experience. Having breadth of knowledge all in one place creates a sense of focus when presented with lots of information.  Data which respects context and references makes a natural environment for learning. The choice of which datasets to implement are limited only by any distribution rights that need to be respected. As long as data is not from redundant sources, subject matter is open to any datasets which are media-rich, as if everything presented is keeping in mind anyone who is looking for visual or media reference.</div>


<div class="orbitron">
        Presenting data from established structures differently.
</div>
<div class="m24">In the case where data is structured under a framework such as Mediawiki, a table-of-contents is created as a user-interface for accessing a curation of pages. An alteration of major layout structure cannot happen in any live wikipedia application whether it be wikipedia itself or fandom.com pages, so the library serves to take already established datasets and repurpose them to be more accessible. Mediawiki is parsed without any of its original css in mind, reformatted to be styled with the css of the library.</div>

<div class="orbitron">Curatorial guidance.</div>
<div class="m24">By pruning queries or data in a way which still preserves overall completeness, datasets at the library avoid the meta-data-only problem. People will not miss records of museum objects having no media. The same goes for any records where media quality is underserved due to copyright policies.</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Style as the substance.
</div>
<div class="m24">
        The library is responsive while being graphical with css. It appears to be science-fiction themed within the limits of css using transparent panels and border lines that are handled with rather acute values. This manner of style shows that visual personality can be applied to modern layout needs through careful consideration. This documentation borrows some of the styles from the library.
</div>


<div class="orbitron">
        Free.
</div>
<div class="m24">
        Everyone is eligible for access to the library at any time. There are no accounts related to usage. This makes the visit less restrictive than a physical library where one needs a card for access. There are no commercial aspects to the site such as advertisements which cut away from the coziness of the design, which is one problem that the library is looking to address and not contribute to.
</div>

<div class="orbitron">Doing the right thing right now.</div>
<div class="m24">
        The amount of underused libraries for web applications available today is rather large. We need not the future for what we can do right now. It's not hard to imagine such resources stay in the bin due to the fact that we undervalue our own output in favor of the media consolidation which harbors most of the world's attention; being the social-media applications whom all of the world are plugged into. The library stands as an establishment which offers everything that the world outside of academia does not do very freely, and that is be the best that it can be without turning people into products or having it cost them anything.
</div>

<div class="orbitron">Considered Dataset Implementations</div>

<div class="m24"> 
        <p>Datasets which fall under consideration for integration into the library are those where data-quality<span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span> is adequate and data-use restrictions are lenient. Subject matter of any kind is otherwise welcome. The 2 dozen currently implemented datasets run across the domains of art, games, literature, media, music, science, and toys. New sources are evaluated and implemented during development. Some datasets are large, spanning millions of records collected over decades such as data from the Smithsonian or NASA. </p>
        
        <p class="mb"><span style="color:rgb(72, 255, 0);">*</span> Quality data is media-rich, complete or sufficiently complete in its metadata, and consistent in its structure.</p> 
</div>

<div class="orbitron">Layout Considerations</div> 
<div class="m24"> 
        <p>Each dataset in the library is presented through a consistent two to three-panel layout: left column, main panel, and a potential third panel. This familiar structure provides a stable interface while still allowing each implementation to adapt to the unique qualities of its data source. For example, an art-museum dataset may use the left column for filtering options and the right panel for browsing results. A dataset derived from a MediaWiki source may instead use the left column as a table of contents (which does not exist in Wiki sites), with the right panel dedicated to the article data. In cases where both filtering and hierarchical navigation are required, a third panel is added for query results. This system allows the library to accommodate any of its data structures while maintaining familiarity.</p>
        <p class="mb">Careful attention is given to preventing layout shift across the interface. When panels contain extensive content, scrollbars are applied selectively so that the left and right panels remain aligned and visible together. Additional optimizations such as dynamic-panel-sizing ensure stability in areas that would otherwise cause significant movement or resizing during interaction. The combination of science-fiction–inspired CSS and layout management contributes to the comfort in the library’s user interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Faster Data Access
</div>
<div class="m24 flexcolumn"> 
        Page layouts for query results do their best to present as much information at once as possible. Commonly in other sites, you would have thumbnails which are linked to full page views. The library however, when applicable, has the thumbnail coupled with its complete meta-data laid out in the query results, which makes the data for all returned records displayed immediately. This significantly cuts down on excess user navigation.
</div>

<div class="orbitron">
        Record Curation
</div>
<div class="m24 flexcolumn"> 
        Real world data is messy, and even data from prestigious institutions such as Smithsonian and MET are littered with media-poor records. The library's queries are tuned to prune away any media-poor records. This ensures that users get what they came for. In some cases, copyright restrictions will limit the quality of a record in one way or another such as reducing an audio clip to but a few seconds or disabling the display of an image, and those are also under consideration for query omission.
